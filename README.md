# IOT Home-School Dashboard

### What is it?
* This Dashboard consists of two main parts: an [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) _(Microcontroller with Wifi)_ & a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/) _(a low powered altoid tin can sized computer)_
* The ESP8266 is used as an alarm clock to connect to your home network
* The Pi (Raspberry Pi) is beinng used as a home server to host a webapp to track a child's performance and to set different alarms for the ESP8266
